<h3 id="11-what-is-the-internet">1.1 What Is the Internet?</h3>

<p>The internet is a computer network that interconnects billions of computing devices throughout the world. All of these devices are called <strong>hosts</strong> or <strong>end systems</strong>. (computers, smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc.)</p>

<p>End Systems are connected together by a network of <strong>communication links</strong>(coaxial cable, copper wire, optical fiber, and radio spectrum) and <strong>packet switches(</strong>.</p>

<p>Transmitting data with the transmission rate means the estimated time to send the data to another destination can differ depends on the transmission rate.</p>

<p>A packet is a small segment of a larger message/data. The sending end system segments the data to packets and then sent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into the original data.</p>

<p>A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forward that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. <strong>routers</strong> and <strong>link-layer switches</strong>.</p>

<p>The sequence of packets traveling is known as a <strong>route</strong> or <strong>path</strong> through the network.</p>

<p>End systems access the Internet through <strong>Internet Service Providers (ISPs)</strong>.</p>

<p>ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the end systems.</p>

<p>End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run protocols that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet.</p>

<p>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) are two of the most important protocols in the Internet.</p>

<p>End systems attached to the Internet provide a socket interface that specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system.</p>

<p>This Internet socket interface is a set of rules that the sending program must follow so that the Internet ca n deliver the data to the destination program.</p>

<p>Human Protocol (for easy understanding) dictates that one first offer a greeting (“Hi”) to initiate communication with someone else. The typical response to a “Hi” is a returned “Hi” message.</p>

<p>There are specific messages we send, and specific actions we take in response to the received reply messages or other events.</p>

<p>It takes two (or more) communicating entities running the same protocol in order to accomplish a task.</p>

<p>A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.</p>
