# Chapter 1 Computer Networks and the Internet

### 1.1 What Is the Internet?

The internet is a computer network that interconnects billions of computing devices throughout the world. All of these devices are called **hosts** or **end systems**. (computers, smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc.) 

End Systems are connected together by a network of **communication links**(coaxial cable, copper wire, optical fiber, and radio spectrum) and **packet switches(**. 

Transmitting data with the transmission rate means the estimated time to send the data to another destination can differ depends on the transmission rate. 

A packet is a small segment of a larger message/data. The sending end system segments the data to packets and then sent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into the original data. 

A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forward that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. **routers** and **link-layer switches**. 

The sequence of packets traveling is known as a **route** or **path** through the network.

End systems access the Internet through **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**.

ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the end systems. 

End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run protocols that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet. 

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) are two of the most important protocols in the Internet. 

End systems attached to the Internet provide a socket interface that specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system. 

This Internet socket interface is a set of rules that the sending program must follow so that the Internet ca n deliver the data to the destination program. 

Human Protocol (for easy understanding) dictates that one first offer a greeting ("Hi") to initiate communication with someone else. The typical response to a "Hi" is a returned "Hi" message. 

There are specific messages we send, and specific actions we take in response to the received reply messages or other events. 

It takes two (or more) communicating entities running the same protocol in order to accomplish a task. 

A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.
